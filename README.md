- ðŸ‘‹ Yello, Iâ€™m @Emzyx (carlos)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in integrating machine learning and AI within full stack applications. Most of my professional experience is in Full Stack, so I'm slowly upscaling in machine learning, but man, it's been moving crazy fast huh?

Otherwise I'm a generally a bit goofy, unsure if in a good or bad way. 

I work on dumb and good projects, both coding and non-coding wise. I love coding so it's my main thing, but as will be visible on my pages site as I make more, I've 'cobbled' my own 50 inch shoes, made some of my own furniture, along with a couple of other failed projects. But successes come with a lot of failure, but generally if I do it, I'll do it to the best of my ability, and learn as much as I can throughout.
